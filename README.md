### Work Experience:
My work experience spans diverse roles in customer service, operations management, and technical support. As Lead Bartender at Lucky Strike, I drove revenue growth, optimized customer service, and trained new hires, enhancing team efficiency and guest satisfaction. In my role as a Teaching Assistant for Calculus I & II, I supported student learning through targeted tutoring and feedback, helping to improve performance and comprehension. As Kitchen Director, I managed a 36-person team, implemented an efficient ticketing system to streamline operations, and played a key role in customer service and menu planning, reducing average wait times significantly. Additionally, in my role at the IT Service Desk, I led a team of associates, streamlined ticketing processes, managed helplines, and worked with networking and system maintenance, enhancing daily operational efficiency.

I am actively seeking opportunities in the finance and finance technology sectors, with a focus on roles in Quantitative Finance, Quantitative Research, and Quantitative Trading. I am also interested in positions like Data Scientist, where I can leverage my skills in data analysis, financial modeling, and quantitative methods. With a solid foundation in applied mathematics, hands-on experience in financial optimization, and a passion for data-driven decision-making, I am eager to contribute to innovative teams that push the boundaries of financial analysis and technology.
